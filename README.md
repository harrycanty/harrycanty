# 👋 Hi, I'm Harry

I'm a Finance student learning and developing tools at the intersection of markets, data, and code.

I use Python, APIs, and libraries like Streamlit and NumPy to turn financial theory into functional apps. I’m especially focused on equity valuation, simulation-based modelling, and options pricing.
